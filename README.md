# Curriculum Logs Project (Team Have it Your Way)

Group project between with team members Keila Camarillo and Brian ONeil

## Project Description

* Using the dataset for curriculum website logs from CodeUp, Ms. Boss Person has multiple questions to be answered about the data prior to her meeting. Our team will acquire, prep, and explore the data using anomaly detection, time-series, and clustering to answer the questions. An email will be prepared and pushed to Ms. Boss Person explaining the answers to the questions along with an attached slide to summarize the findings.

## Project Goals

* Working as a team, acquire, prep, and explore the curriculum website logs to answer at least five questions as complete as possible.

* Craft an email answering Ms. Boss' questions in complete from the findings in data exploration.

* Create a slide summarizing the answers to the bosses questions found in data exploration.

* Other key drivers:
    * Answer the following questions:
    * 1. Which lesson appears to attract the most traffic consistently across cohorts (per program)?
    * 2. Is there a cohort that referred to a lesson significantly more than other cohorts seemed to gloss over?
    * 3. Are there students who, when active, hardly access the curriculum? If so, what information do you have about these students?
    * 6. What topics are grads continuing to reference after graduation and into their jobs (for each program)?
    * 7. Which lessons are least accessed?

## Initial Thoughts

* We believe there is enough data to explore in the dataset to answer all of the questions.

## The Plan

* Acquire 

* Prepare the data using the following columns: 
    * features:
        * date
        * endpoint
        * user_id
        * cohort_id
        * source_ip

* Explore dataset to answer questions:
    * Answer the following questions:
    * 1. Which lesson appears to attract the most traffic consistently across cohorts (per program)?
    * 2. Is there a cohort that referred to a lesson significantly more than other cohorts seemed to gloss over?
    * 3. Are there students who, when active, hardly access the curriculum? If so, what information do you have about these students?
    * 6. What topics are grads continuing to reference after graduation and into their jobs (for each program)?
    * 7. Which lessons are least accessed?
